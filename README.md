# Circuit Python Web Interface

This is a basic websockets interface for communicating with the webrepl on a device running Circuit Python.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate using websockets to create a connection to the webrepl to manipulate GPIO pins. This is just a simple demonstraton. Once the websocket is open, any valid Circuit Python code can be sent and executed just as it would be in the repl or webrepl interface.

Webrepl must be enabled on your device for this to function. If it is not, instructions can be found here https://learn.adafruit.com/micropython-basics-esp8266-webrepl/access-webrepl .
